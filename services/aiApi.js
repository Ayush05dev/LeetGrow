${questionContent}

The original problem statement shows sample test cases and below i am providing how they actually looks in the format so with this similar format generate more(8) testcases. (each input element on its own line, with no commas separating test cases):

\`\`\`
${givenTestcases}
\`\`\`

‚ö†Ô∏è Notice:
- For ech input inside a single tetscases there should be different line for different variables to be input like if there is one 2d array and 2 1d array then there should be 3 lines one line for input of 2d array then no comma direct next line then input fist 1d array then in next line another 1d array and like that.
- Lets take another exmaple in which two integer variables input and one 2d array then in that case according to question which one comes first array or integer variable take input of that and then in next line (no comma in previous line ) take remain array of variable input and then similarly in next line remainig variable or array input.
- **Each array or number is on its own line.**  
- **There are NO commas between separate test cases.**  
- Once one test case finishes (after its last line), the very next line begins the next test case.

---

üéØ Your task:
Generate **exactly eight (8)** new test case **inputs** that:
1. Cover **all** edge cases and typical scenarios.
2. Follow **exactly** the same **line-by-line** structure as above.
3. Do **NOT** include any labels, commas, or extra formatting‚Äîjust raw arrays/numbers, one per line.

---

‚úÖ Example (from above):
\`\`\`
[1,2,2,1]
[2,2]
3
6
[4,9,5]
[9,4,9,8,4]
5
8
\`\`\`
Here there are **two** complete test cases (4 lines each), back-to-back.

---

Now, based on the problem and using that exact format, output **8** test cases (each test case‚Äôs values on separate lines, and no commas between test‚Äêcases).`;

Given the following LeetCode problem description and the submitted solution:

--- Problem Description ---
${content}

--- Submitted Code ---
${code}

Your tasks:
1. Analyze whether the code solves the problem correctly.
2. Identify logical errors, edge cases missed, or bugs.
3. Suggest improvements and fixes.
4. If applicable, include a corrected version of the code.

üìå Important: Return the output strictly as a JSON array of issues in the following format (no explanation or text before/after the JSON):

[
{
  "issueHeading": "Brief title of the issue",
  "detail": "Detailed explanation of the issue, e.g., what's wrong or missing.",
  "solution": "Suggestion to fix the issue or improve the code."
},
{
  "issueHeading": "Another issue",
  "detail": "Explanation of the second issue.",
  "solution": "How to resolve or improve it."
}
]

‚úÖ Example:

[
{
  "issueHeading": "Fails for empty input",
  "detail": "The code does not handle the case when the input array is empty, which may lead to runtime errors.",
  "solution": "Add a condition to check if the array is empty at the beginning of the function."
},
{
  "issueHeading": "Inefficient loop structure",
  "detail": "The nested loop causes O(n^2) complexity which is not optimal for large inputs.",
  "solution": "Use a hash map to reduce the time complexity to O(n)."

  1: If the list has no nodes (head is null), it should safely return no cycle.

  3: A list with one node that points to itself (i.e., head.next = head).
  4: A standard linked list with multiple nodes and no cycle (last node points to null).
